# Game

[![Test](https://github.com/Elixir-Meetup-Rostock/game/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Elixir-Meetup-Rostock/game/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Goals

This game is an experiment by the [Elixir Meetup Rostock](https://github.com/Elixir-Meetup-Rostock).

We are building a multiplayer browser game with Elixir & LiveView and (on the way) learn as much as possible.

## MVP

* We have a closed map with objects like trees
* Players from two factions can run around the map
* Players of opposing teams can hit each other
* Players can hide behind objects to avoid being hit
* There is a counter with K/D ratio for the teams

## Status: Work in progress

- You start in a /lobby where you pick your name and jump into the game.
- The game itself is currently only about movement and displaying all connected players and their movement in realtime.
- From here we start building the game logic and develop the game further

## To start your Phoenix server:

- Install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) and [PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)
- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
